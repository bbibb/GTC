Final Project Extra Credit Notes

I interpreted this program to be a tool used by the benefit organizer to track the details of their event in process, and to get a financial report at the conclusion of the event.

Additional attendee types:
    VIP, staff, children, musician
        VIP, staff, and musicians have no charge for their meals.
        Children are at 75% discount.

Additional meal types:
    Fish, Kosher, Vegan, and Child's meals
        Each meal type has it's own wholesale cost, figured into the final numbers.

More detailed data handling and reports:
    1. The financial_report() calculates the total cost per type of meal (number of entrees * wholesale cost), adds those values to the venue cost, and subtracts the total amount paid to generate a "final profit" number. If the planner sees that these numbers are not going well, they can raise meal prices or cut costs to adjust.

    2. The find_person() function will return all matches for the person's last name. Then, the planner can use the delete_person() or edit_person() functions by entering the full name of that individual. 

    3. User is given a confirmation warning before deleting or editing an attendee record.


Extra features:
    1. The planner can change the cost of each expense using the update_prices() function, including the base meal cost, child discount, wholesale price for each meal type, and the cost to use the venue.

    2. The planner can generate a randomized list of attendees, organized into 8-person tables. The seating_chart() function calculates how many tables are needed and fills each up in turn.
