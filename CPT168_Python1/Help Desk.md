End user needs analysis

needs analysis
	investigating situation and problem
needs assessment
	evaluating results and making recommendation or decision

Which hardware and software products and services best meet user's requirements

I. Preparation Phase Activities
1. Understand the end user's and organization's goals
2. Understand the decision criteria and constraints
3. Define the problem clearly
4. Identify the roles of stakeholders
5. Identify sources of information
II. Investigation Phase Activities
1. Develop an understanding of existing technology
2. Investigate alternatives to the existing technology
III. Decision Phase Activities
1. Develop a model of the proposed solution
2. Make a build-vs-buy decision


**User Needs Analysis Steps and Tasks**
Preparation - goals, criteria, constraints, define the problem
Investigation - understand existing, alternatives
Decision - proposed solution, decide

Step 1 Understand the End User's and Organization's Goals
	for profit? growth plans? attitude? history? budget? experience?

Step 2 Understand the decision criteria and constraints
	**feasibility study**
		economic, operational, technological, timeline feasibility
	business culture factors - conservative or leading-edge?
		inside or outside expertise reliance?

Step 3 Define the problem clearly
	technical, organizational, personnel, workflow, training, office politics, resource problems?

Step 4 Identify the roles of stakeholders
Stakeholders: participants who stands to gain/lose from the success or failure of the assessment project
Write a profile of each person's roles and responsibilities
	*End Users*
		which ones, responsibilities, capabilities, roles
	*Managers*
		"project sponsor" - group or an executive committee, or a person
		who makes the final decision?
		info, background and priority
	*IT staff*
		responsible for installing, configuring, maintaining, troubleshooting
	*Support Analysts*
		clarify role, time commitment, responsibilities

Step 5 Identify sources of information
	- interviews
	- surveys
	- manuals
	- direct observation
	- forms
	- reports
	- problem-report histories or logs
	- diagrams of workflow
	- equipment inventory
	- reports from outside auditors, consultants, vendors

Step 6 Develop an understanding of the existing technology
	documents, interviews with key participants, observation
	organize info in project notebook
	**model** - narrative or graphic - describes existing system
		business activity
		network of servers and hardware
		can use software tools to make, eg MS Visio
	Questions
		Do I understand and can explain technology and workflow
		Do I understand which features are liked
		Do I understand users' problems with the existing system

Step 7 Investigate Alternatives to existing technology
Look at comparable users, industry sources and trade publications
Kinds:
	Additional resources
		personnel, equipment, budget, time, priority
	Changes to existing resources
		training?
	Upgrades
		speed, storage, compatibility, features
	New hardware
	New software
	Improved workflow
		efficiency

Step 8 Develop a model of the proposed solution
Narrative, graphic aids, description
	Why is this an improvement?
	Why is it the best available alternative
**Cost benefit Analysis**
	expenses compared with payoff
Software is more important than hardware in meeting user needs
	software needs drive hardware selection

Step 9: Make a build-vs-buy decision
	custom solution, or off the shelf
	**turnkey system**
		hardware, software, network, services from single vendor
		combo of custom and off the shelf
	Custom: user needs tailored, business advantages
	OtS: lower acquisition cost, faster implementation, docs, standard user interfaces, fewer bugs, ongoing support options
	Buy-vs-Lease

Every situation is unique
	budget constraints, subjective factors

**Needs Analysis and Assessment Tools**

satisficing solution - reasonable but not necessary optimal, which may be too expensive or impractical

Project Charter
	short narrative that answers basic questions
		objectives, scope, methods, participants, deliverables, steps, timeline, how success will be measures
	high level overview
	needs sign-off from everyone
	
Cost-benefit Analysis
	tool for costs and benefits
	Payback Period - time for benefits to exceed costs
	Acquisition Costs
		equipment, software, services, supplies, time, admin
	Operating Costs
		lease, salaries, supplies, maintenance, training
	Benefit - reduced expenses
	Benefit - increased revenue opportunities
		expanded market, higher prices due to better quality
	Intangible benefits
		new tech, image, service to clients, morale
		

Data-collection Instruments
	**Input forms** - "source document"
		collect info
	Output forms 
		business transactions or processes, receipts
	Procedure documentation
		steps
	Operating or problem logs
		routine, periodic info about events that occur normally
		errors, problems, shortages, complaints
	Interviews and questionnaires
		face to face, probe
		focus group - small, representative sample of users
	Direct observation
		watch users work

Charts and Diagrams
	manually or with tools
	Flowcharts
		schematic drawing, symbols to represent the parts or steps
		diamonds - decision points or questions
		lines to connect
	I-P-O chart
		Input, Processing, Output
		info, steps, results
		

Prototyping Software
	working model for users to try
	eg Access, Excel, VB, JS to build prototype of a menu structure
	
Project Management software

**Managing a User Support Project**
Project management - detailed, step by step plan and process to reach the goal

Step 1: Project Definition
	prelim work
	Project Goal - specific, measurable result, ultimate outcome
		how will you know you achieved it?

Step 2: Project Planning
	divide into tasks, estimate time for each, assign resources
		time, budget, space, equipment, supplies, support, admin
	Project Task
		something specific that has to get done
	Project Plan
		pulls together all Tasks into one document
		What tasks, in what sequence, by whom, how long, with what resources?
	Risk Factors
		problems that could arise
		illness, delay, conflict

Step 3: Project implementation
	Project manager's job here is task coordination
	resolve conflicts, allocate resources, deal with problems
	Models:
		Direct Conversion
		Parallel Conversion
		Phased Implementation
		Pilot Project
	Two important Steps:
		Testing (QA, quality assurance)
		Documentation
	

Step 4: Project monitoring
	ongoing status of all tasks
		how much work? what remains?
		should resources by adjusted?
		impact of any changes on completion date
	Avoid **scope creep**, project grows and changes, increased cost and time
	**Change management procedures**
		change orders and follow-up communication
		

Step 5: Project termination
	Communicate completion to stakeholders
	final project report
	evaluate performance of team managers and members

Project Management Tools
Software
	MS Project Professional 
	Milestones Simplicity
	Project-Open
Gantt chart
	tasks, with relationships and expected timeline
	Predecessor Tasks
		must be completed before another one begins
	Critical Path
		sequence of tasks that must be completed on time
